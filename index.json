[{"content":"The E-Tech Lab\u003e The E-Tech Lab # The first meeting in the lab we learned about electrical engineering. First, Johannes told us a few quick things about the history. Then he taught us the basics of electrical circuits like amperage, voltage and resistance and their correlation to one another. After that we learnt how to measure these things with a multimeter.\nThe next step for us was soldering. We got a soldering board and some components to solder on. We were soldering without lead so the first step after putting the component into the board was to apply some flux to get the solder onto the board. Then we could just hold the soldering iron on the board and put some solder on it. The first two components soldered onto the board All components soldered onto the board A resistor connected to a multimeter The next task was to use a multimeter to measure voltage and amperage to calculate the resistance. For that we used a breadboard to build a circuit where we connected the voltage-multimeter parallel to the resistor and the amperage-multimeter in series to the resistor. The circuit without the amperage-multimeter connected Then we measured the amperage and voltage for different settings in the power adapter and noted everything down. When we got enough data we calculated the resistance of the resistor for every setting and calculated the median. To check if our calculations and measurements were right we checked them against the resistance measurement of the multimeter and our calculated median was close to the actual value. Two resistors connected in series The last task was to calculate the resistance of a second resistor when the resistance of the first resistor is already given. So we did the measurements with a few settings again and then we transformed the given equation from the script to calculate the resitance. After checking the calculated value again with the measured resistance we got close to the value again.\nEven though I already soldered in the past and also built some circuits before, the lab was pretty useful to fresh up on those things and also to have a reference to look at later for the project.\nMy project for the first semester\u003e My project for the first semester # Finally we get to the project I have chosen to do in the first semester. I have decided to go for the Battlebot and go for an aesthetic design like a 3D printed head. I also wanted to do the RetroPie Gamestation but ultimately i decided to take the project where I have a bit more freedom and have to program. My premature circuit looks as follows: Premature circuit board for the Battlebot ","date":"9 November 2022","permalink":"/swhDocJG/posts/etechlab/","section":"Posts","summary":"The E-Tech Lab\u003e The E-Tech Lab # The first meeting in the lab we learned about electrical engineering.

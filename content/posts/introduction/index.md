Welcome to my Documentation of the course "Sketching with Hardware"!

My name is Jeremy Gopp and I'm currently in my 7th Semester of studying Mediainformatics at the Ulm University.

I chose this course to broaden my horizons, as I only worked with software in the past and getting to know the 
hardware side of things might be beneficial to me and also it seems like it will be fun!

If I could already build my own hardware projects, I would probably build something to enhance my workflow 
on the projects I'm currently working on, as the need arises. For example the FreeDeck I presented in the
second Meeting to have easily accessable shortcuts or a note stand that tracks what notes i hit and with what delay
from a predefined notesheet.

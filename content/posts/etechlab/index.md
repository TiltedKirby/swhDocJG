## The E-Tech Lab

The first meeting in the lab we learned about electrical engineering.
First, Johannes told us a few quick things about the history. Then he 
taught us the basics of electrical circuits like amperage, voltage and 
resistance and their correlation to one another. After that we learnt 
how to measure these things with a multimeter.

The next step for us was soldering. We got a soldering board and some 
components to solder on. We were soldering without lead so the first step 
after putting the component into the board was to apply some flux to get 
the solder onto the board. Then we could just hold the soldering iron
on the board and put some solder on it.

The next task was to use a multimeter to measure voltage and amperage to 
calculate the resistance. For that we used a breadboard to build a circuit 
where we connected the voltage-multimeter parallel to the resistor and the 
amperage-multimeter in series to the resistor.

Then we measured the amperage and voltage for different settings in the 
power adapter and noted everything down. When we got enough data we calculated 
the resistance of the resistor for every setting and calculated the median. 
To check if our calculations and measurements were right we checked them 
against the resistance measurement of the multimeter and our calculated 
median was close to the actual value.

The last task was to calculate the resistance of a second resistor when 
the resistance of the first resistor is already given. So we did the 
measurements with a few settings again and then we transformed the 
given equation from the script to calculate the resitance. After checking 
the calculated value again with the measured resistance we got close 
to the value again.

Even though I already soldered in the past and also built some circuits 
before, the lab was pretty useful to fresh up on those things and also to 
have a reference to look at later for the project.

## My project for the first semester

Finally we get to the project I have chosen to do in the first semester. 
I have decided to go for the Battlebot and go for an aesthetic design 
like a 3D printed head. I also wanted to do the RetroPie Gamestation 
but ultimately I decided to take the project where I have a bit more 
freedom and have to program. My premature circuit looks as follows:

First, Johannes told us a few quick things about the history. Then he taught us the basics of electrical circuits like amperage, voltage and resistance and their correlation to one another.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://tiltedkirby.github.io/swhDocJG/posts/introduction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 20:21:25 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://tiltedkirby.github.io/swhDocJG/posts/introduction/</guid><description>Welcome to my documentation of the course &amp;ldquo;Sketching with Hardware&amp;rdquo;!
My name is Jeremy Gopp and I&amp;rsquo;m currently in my 7th semester of studying Mediainformatics at the Ulm University.
I chose this course to broaden my horizons, as I only worked with software in the past and getting to know the hardware side of things might be beneficial to me and also it seems like it will be fun!</description></item></channel></rss>

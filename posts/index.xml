My name is Jeremy Gopp and I&amp;rsquo;m currently in my 7th Semester of studying Mediainformatics at the Ulm University.
I chose this course to broaden my horizons, as I only worked with software in the past and getting to know the hardware side of things might be beneficial to me and also it seems like it will be fun!</description></item></channel></rss>
